# Cellular Automata, Screen Buffers, and Conway's "Game of Life"

Over the course of this week, students will work on creating their own application in which users will be able to run different "Game of Life" scenarios. This module leads the reader through the fundamentals of Conways's "Game of Life" and will guide them through the process of creating an app utilizing tools and frameworks that have been taught over the course of their specific track.


## Objectives
* Student should be able to create a unique, high-quality project that can be added to a professional portfolio
* Student should be able to describe the rules of Conway’s “Game of Life”
* Student should be able to explain what cellular automata are and describe how they are useful in real life
* Student should be able to correctly analyze the ‘Turing Completeness’ of Conway’s “Game of Life”
* Student should be able to implement a visualization of Conway’s “Game of Life” using technologies related to their specific track
* Student should be able to utilize animation in the aforementioned visualization
* Student should be able to utilize “double buffering” to implement animations
